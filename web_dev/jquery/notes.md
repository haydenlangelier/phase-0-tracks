I decide i was going to use the resources on khanacademy for the bulk of my training on SQL. The videos were made by jen gilbert and the creator of jquery works at khan and helped with the videos. I spent in between 2-3 hours watching the instructional videos, changing the jquery at the end of the page, replacing text, changing css and html, inserting random stuff etc. Breaks help alot with focus and i took several. Its best to usually just address the with the global variable. You then put the tag or id you are looking for followed by text attr html etc. You can leave it blank and set it equal to a variable to store the current contents. I also googled some other jquery commands on google and added two bookmarks that may come in handy later.
