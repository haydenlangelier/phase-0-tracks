What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux was created by Linus Torvalds to be open and free for all to use. It kept many design principles of the Unix operating system. It was designed with the notion that the user was competent at programing. Thus it is easy to screw up. However, you have complete and utter freedom to do anything you want without the OS getting in your way. It continues to developed by the entire Linux community and constantly modified. Many different versions of it exist today. 

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A virtual private server is essentialy a virtual machine, aka someone else hardware where you have full access to the OS. You can tell it do anything you want, install anything you want, you have full command. The business model is like most SAAS companies in that you pay to rent specific hardware for an alloted amount of time. The primary advantages are the low cost and the ability to tailor to accomplish almost anything you want. 

Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

It is bad primarily for security reasons and that you can easily corrupt your system. If your logged into root you have full access to the computer and can be more easily hacked. Also bugs/vulnerabilites have access to everything. And its dangerous to modify the OS at the root level becuase you could easily destroy everything.
