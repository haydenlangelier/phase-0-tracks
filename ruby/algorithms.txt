Common Task

Grocery Shopping

1. Check current inventory: Program could help track inventory in my fridge. 
2. Refill logic: program could alert me to go shopping when i reach a certain level, ie low or out of something. if statement or until. 
3. Shopping list: It could print out my shopping list for me and tell me what i need to buy that i am low on. I could also input what else i want to buy
4. Shopping experience: As i grab each item it could track how many i need and how many i currently have. Or if possible it could purchase them for me online.
5. Tracking. Once im back it could check inventory again to make sure am good and also update me on any shipping notifications. 
6. Reminders. It could provide any set of automated reminders.
