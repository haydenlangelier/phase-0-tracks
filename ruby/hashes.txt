Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
So you can store and interate through data appropriately. 

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
List of items of any sort. You can use strings, booleans, integers, floats, other arrays, hashes or whatever really. You can access the index and use a variety of array class methods. 

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
Average weather over time, random number generator

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
Merely a data type that stores something under key value pair. 

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
Student Profile, Online forms

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
So you can reduce redundant code by executing the same code on a large dataset. 

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
Computing the likelyhood to buy based off 1000 factors on their profile.

Blocks
8. What is a block?
chunk of code that operates under a given parameter or none at all. 

9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
Its a piece of code that allow inputs, and is transmitted to the function.
