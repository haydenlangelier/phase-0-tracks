1. What are classes? Be sure to define the following terms in your explanation and describe the relationships between them:

class A class is a construct that all instances of that class will follow, they will inherit its methods, attributes, etc. 
state- state is merely the present condition of an instance, eg attributes
behavior- the methods of an instance
instance variable-all instances contain @, these are the instance variables, they differ between each instance
instance method- anything preded by def methodname, they are they particular instance method that can be called. 
2. What are attributes?
Attributes contain the state of an instance and are accessed with @
3. Give an example of a real world object, and describe how you might assign its attributes if you were to design a class to represent that object.
I would use computers as the class, and then for Macintosh class it would have a customer opreating system and hardware. 
4. What is the purpose of the initialize method? When does it run?
Its purpose is to assign state data when the instance is initiated, it runs when it is first called. 
5. What are modules?
Modules are function/methods that can supplement your code. 
6. What are the different ways you can use a module?
They can be mixed in by putting them before your classes or you can use require to include their functionailty in your code.
